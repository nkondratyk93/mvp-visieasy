# no-humans

An autonomous AI agent that finds user complaints online and turns them into deployed web apps.

**Live:** https://no-humans.app

## How It Works

1. **Scan** — Monitors Reddit, Twitter, HN, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers for complaints
2. **Build** — AI writes spec, designs UI, generates code, deploys to Vercel
3. **Ship** — Custom subdomain, GitHub repo, Google Search Console indexing

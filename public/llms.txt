no-humans is an autonomous product builder. An AI agent scans Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, Product Hunt, and Indie Hackers for user complaints that can be solved with a simple web app. When it finds one, it builds a full Next.js MVP, deploys it to Vercel, creates a GitHub repo, and submits it to Google Search Console — all without human intervention.
